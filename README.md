# CITS3403 Project 1 Website
Computing Building 101

# Description 
This is our group project submission for CITS3403 Agile Web Development.

The purpose of our project is to develop a web-based platform, where users learn about the components used in building
desktop computers. Users are able to learn about this through our content page where they will learn the essentials of each component used
to build a computer. Users are then prompted to take a quiz to access their knowledge and what they have learnt.

        The CPU stands for Central Processing Unit. Being the "brain" of the computer, the CPU functions as the main control center of all computer operations.
        It has four specific functions: to fetch, execute, decode, and store instructions. 
        A CPU contains cores, which are units in a CPU that can run different processes. 
        The more cores a CPU has, the faster the computer will be.
